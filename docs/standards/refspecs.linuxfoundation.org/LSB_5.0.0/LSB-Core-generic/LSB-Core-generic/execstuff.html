>In general, applications should not depend on running as a privileged user.
This specification uses the term "appropriate privilege" throughout to identify
operations that cannot be achieved without some special granting of additional
privilege.</P

>Applications that have a reason to run with appropriate privilege
should outline this reason clearly in their documentation.
Users of the application should be informed, that "this application 
demands security privileges, which could interfere with system security".</P

>The application should not contain binary-only software that 
requires being run with appropriate privilege, as this makes security auditing 
harder or even impossible. </P

Should an application require that certain files and directories
not directly belonging to the package have a particular ownership,
the application shall document this requirement, and may fail during
installation if the permissions on these files is inappropriate.</P

environment.  Examples of such restrictions could be
default mount options that disable set-user/group-ID
attributes, disabling block or character-special files on
the medium, or remapping the user and group IDs of files away
from any privileged value.
