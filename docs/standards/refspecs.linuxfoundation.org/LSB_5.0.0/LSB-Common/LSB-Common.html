>Introduction</H1
><P
>The LSB defines a binary interface for application programs that
are compiled and packaged for LSB-conforming implementations on many
different hardware architectures. A binary specification must include
information specific to the computer processor architecture for which
it is intended. To avoid the complexity of conditional descriptions,
the specification has instead been divided into generic parts which are
augmented by one of several architecture-specific parts, depending on
the target processor architecture; the generic part will indicate when
reference must be made to the architecture part, and vice versa.</P
><P
>This document should be used in conjunction with the documents it
references. This document enumerates the system components it includes,
but descriptions of those components may be included entirely or partly
in this document, partly in other documents, or entirely in other
reference documents. For example, the section that describes system
service routines includes a list of the system routines supported in
this interface, formal declarations of the data structures they use that
are visible to applications, and a pointer to the underlying referenced
specification for information about the syntax and semantics of each
call. Only those routines not described in standards referenced by
this document, or extensions to those standards, are described in the
detail. Information referenced in this way is as much a part of this
document as is the information explicitly included here.</P
><P
>The specification carries a version number of either the form
<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>x.y</I
></TT
> or <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>x.y.z</I
></TT
>. This
version number carries the following meaning:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>The first number (<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>x</I
></TT
>) is the major version
number. Versions sharing the same major version number shall be compatible
in a backwards direction; that is, a newer version shall be compatible
with an older version. Any deletion of a library results in a new major
version number. Interfaces marked as deprecated may be removed from the
specification at a major version change.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The second number (<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>y</I
></TT
>) is the minor
version number. Libraries and individual interfaces may be added, but
not removed. Interfaces may be marked as deprecated at a minor version
change. Other minor changes may be permitted at the discretion of the
LSB workgroup.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The third number (<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>z</I
></TT
>), if present, is
the editorial level. Only editorial changes should be included in such
versions.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>Since this specification is a descriptive Application Binary Interface,
and not a source level API specification, it is not possible to make a
guarantee of 100% backward compatibility between major releases. However,
it is the intent that those parts of the binary interface that are
visible in the source level API will remain backward compatible from
version to version, except where a feature marked as "Deprecated" in one
release may be removed from a future release. Implementors are strongly
encouraged to make use of symbol versioning to permit simultaneous support
of applications conforming to different releases of this specification.</P

><P
>The Linux Standard Base (LSB) defines a system interface for compiled
applications and a minimal environment for support of installation scripts.
Its purpose is to enable a uniform industry standard environment for
high-volume applications conforming to the LSB.</P
><P
>The LSB specification set is divided into modules,
each of which provides fundamental system interfaces, libraries,
and runtime environment upon which all conforming applications and
libraries using that module depend.</P
><P
>The modules of the Linux Standard Base are:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>LSB Core - core components</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>LSB Desktop - desktop related components</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>LSB Languages - runtime languages</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>LSB Imaging - printing and scanning</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>LSB Trial Use - components that are not yet mandatory</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><P
>Interfaces described in the LSB Core module specification
are supplemented by other LSB module specifications.
All other modules depend on the presence of LSB Core.</P
><P
>These specifications are composed of two basic parts: a common part
describing those parts of the interface that
remain constant across all implementations of the LSB, and an
architecture-specific part describing the
parts of the interface that vary by processor architecture.
Together, the common part and the relevant
architecture-specific part for a single hardware architecture provide a
complete interface specification for compiled application programs on systems
that share a common hardware architecture.
Whenever a section of the common part
is supplemented by architecture-specific information, the common part
includes a reference to the architecture-specific part. 
Architecture-specific parts of of an LSB module specification
may also contain additional information that is not referenced in the
common part.</P
><P
>The LSB contains both a set of Application Program Interfaces (APIs)
and Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs). APIs may appear in the
source code of portable applications, while the compiled binary of that
application may use the larger set of ABIs. A conforming implementation
provides all of the ABIs listed here. The compilation system may
replace (e.g. by macro definition) certain APIs with calls to one or
more of the underlying binary interfaces, and may insert calls to binary
interfaces as needed.</P
><P
>The LSB is primarily a binary interface
definition. Not all of the source level APIs available to applications
may be contained in this specification.</P

    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</P

    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</P
><P
>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P

></H2
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</P

    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P

>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</P
><P
