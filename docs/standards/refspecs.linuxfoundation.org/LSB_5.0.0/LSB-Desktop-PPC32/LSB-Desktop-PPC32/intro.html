>The LSB defines a binary interface for application programs that
are compiled and packaged for LSB-conforming implementations on many
different hardware architectures. A binary specification must include
information specific to the computer processor architecture for which
it is intended. To avoid the complexity of conditional descriptions,
the specification has instead been divided into generic parts which are
augmented by one of several architecture-specific parts, depending on
the target processor architecture; the generic part will indicate when
reference must be made to the architecture part, and vice versa.</P
><P
>This document should be used in conjunction with the documents it
references. This document enumerates the system components it includes,
but descriptions of those components may be included entirely or partly
in this document, partly in other documents, or entirely in other
reference documents. For example, the section that describes system
service routines includes a list of the system routines supported in
this interface, formal declarations of the data structures they use that
are visible to applications, and a pointer to the underlying referenced
specification for information about the syntax and semantics of each
call. Only those routines not described in standards referenced by
this document, or extensions to those standards, are described in the
detail. Information referenced in this way is as much a part of this
document as is the information explicitly included here.</P
><P
>The specification carries a version number of either the form
<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>x.y</I
></TT
> or <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>x.y.z</I
></TT
>. This
version number carries the following meaning:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>The first number (<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>x</I
></TT
>) is the major version
number. Versions sharing the same major version number shall be compatible
in a backwards direction; that is, a newer version shall be compatible
with an older version. Any deletion of a library results in a new major
version number. Interfaces marked as deprecated may be removed from the
specification at a major version change.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The second number (<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>y</I
></TT
>) is the minor
version number. Libraries and individual interfaces may be added, but
not removed. Interfaces may be marked as deprecated at a minor version
change. Other minor changes may be permitted at the discretion of the
LSB workgroup.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The third number (<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>z</I
></TT
>), if present, is
the editorial level. Only editorial changes should be included in such
versions.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>Since this specification is a descriptive Application Binary Interface,
and not a source level API specification, it is not possible to make a
guarantee of 100% backward compatibility between major releases. However,
it is the intent that those parts of the binary interface that are
visible in the source level API will remain backward compatible from
version to version, except where a feature marked as "Deprecated" in one
release may be removed from a future release. Implementors are strongly
encouraged to make use of symbol versioning to permit simultaneous support
of applications conforming to different releases of this specification.</P
