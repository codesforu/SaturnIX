><P
>A processor architecture represents a family of related processors
which may not have identical feature sets. The architecture
specific parts of the LSB Core Specification that supplement this specification for a given target
processor architecture describe a minimum acceptable processor.
The implementation shall provide all features of this processor,
whether in hardware or through emulation transparent
to the application.</P

>The implementation shall be capable of executing compiled applications
having the format and using the system interfaces described in this
specification.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The implementation shall provide libraries containing the interfaces
specified by this specification, and shall provide a dynamic linking
mechanism that allows these interfaces to be attached to applications
at runtime. All the interfaces shall behave as specified in
this specification.</P

>The map of virtual memory provided by the implementation shall conform 
to the requirements of this specification. </P

linkage, system traps, signals, and other such activities shall conform
to the formats described in this specification.</P

>The implementation shall provide all of the mandatory interfaces
in their entirety. </P

>The implementation may provide one or more of the optional
interfaces. Each optional interface that is provided shall be provided
in its entirety. The product documentation shall state which optional
interfaces are provided.</P

>The implementation shall provide all files and utilities specified as
part of this specification in the format defined here and in other documents
normatively included by reference.  
All commands and utilities shall behave as required by this specification. 
The implementation shall also provide all mandatory components of an 
application's runtime environment that are included or referenced in 
this specification.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The implementation, when provided with standard data formats and
values at a named interface, shall provide the behavior defined for
those values and data formats at that interface. However, a conforming
implementation may consist of components which are separately packaged
and/or sold. For example, a vendor of a conforming implementation
might sell the hardware, operating system, and windowing system as
separately packaged items.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The implementation may provide additional interfaces with different
names. It may also provide additional behavior corresponding to data
values outside the standard ranges, for standard named interfaces.</P
