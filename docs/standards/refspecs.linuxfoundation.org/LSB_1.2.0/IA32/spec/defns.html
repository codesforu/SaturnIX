A strictly conforming application does not require or use any interface, facility, or implementation-defined extension that is not defined in this document in order to be installed or to execute successfully. </P
></DD
><DT
>Rationale</DT
><DD
><P
>An LSB conforming application is expected to have no dependencies on any 
vendor extensions to this document. The most common such extensions are 
additional function entry points and additional libraries other than the 
ones defined in this document. If an application requires such extensions, 
it is not portable, since other LSB conforming implementations may not 
provide those extensions. </P
><P
>An LSB conforming application is required to use system services on the 
implementation on which it is running, rather than importing system 
routines from some other implementation. Thus, it must link dynamically 
to any routines in the implementation that perform system traps to 
kernel services. </P
><P
>It is to be expected that some applications may be companion applications 
to other applications. For example, a query application may be a 
companion to a database application; a preprocessor may be an adjunct 
to one or more compilers; a data reformatter may convert data from one 
document manager to another. In such cases, the application may or may 
not be LSB conforming, regardless of whether the other application on 
which it is dependent is LSB conforming. If such an application merely 
uses data produced by another application, the application's compliance is 
independent of the other application's compliance. If such an application 
actually invokes another application during execution (as, for example, 
a third-party math library), the invoking application is LSB conforming
only if it also constitutes a LSB conforming application in combination 
with the invoked application. </P
