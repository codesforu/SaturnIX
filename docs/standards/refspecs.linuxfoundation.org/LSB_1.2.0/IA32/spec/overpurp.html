><P
>The Linux Standard Base (LSB) defines a system interface for compiled
applications and a minimal environment for support of installation scripts.
Its purpose is to enable a uniform industry standard environment for
high-volume applications conforming to the LSB.</P
><P
>The LSB defines a binary interface for application programs that are compiled
and packaged for LSB-conforming implementations on many different hardware
architectures. Since a binary specification must include information specific
to the computer processor architecture for which it is intended, it is not
possible for a single document to specify the interface for all possible
LSB-conforming implementations. Therefore, the LSB is a family of
specifications, rather than a single one.</P
><P
>The LSB is composed of two basic parts: A common part of the specification
describes those parts of the interface that remain constant across all hardware
implementations of the LSB, and an architecture-specific part of the
specification describes the parts of the specification that are specific to a
particular processor architecture. Together, the generic LSB and the
architecture-specific supplement for a single hardware architecture provide a
complete interface specification for compiled application programs on systems
that share a common hardware architecture.</P
><P
>This document is the architecture-specific supplement. It must be used in
conjunction with the generic LSB. This document provides architecture-specific
information that supplements the generic LSB as well as additional information
that is not found in the generic LSB.</P
><P
>This document should be used in conjunction with the documents it references.
This document enumerates the system components it includes, but descriptions of
those components may be included entirely or partly in this document, partly in
other documents, or entirely in other reference documents. For example, the
section that describes system service routines includes a list of the system
routines supported in this interface, formal declarations of the data
structures they use that are visible to applications, and a pointer to the
underlying referenced specification for information about the syntax and
semantics of each call. Only those routines not described in standards
referenced by this document, or extensions to those standards, are described in
the detail. Information referenced in this way is as much a part of this
document as is the information explicitly included here.</P
