with directory write permissions restricted by the "sticky bit".

user. This is classically done with /tmp, to prevent accidental
deletion of "foreign" files.)</P

responsible for assuming that all system commands have the required 
permissions and work correctly.</P

Let us make security officers happy. Let's give them the freedom
to take sgid/suid perms away, as long as they do not break 
the system's functionality.</P

>"Normal" applications should not depend on running as a privileged user.</P
><P
>Special applications that have a reason to run under a privileged user,
should outline these reasons clearly in their documentation, if they
are not obvious as in the case of a backup/restore program.
Users of the application should be informed, that "this application 
demands security privileges, which could interfere with system security".</P
><P

requires being run as root, as this makes security auditing 
harder or even impossible. </P

a warning notice in the documentation is regarded as unfriendly act.</P

><P
>Applications that expect to be runnable from removable
media should not depend on logging in as a privileged user,
and should be prepared to deal with a restrictive
environment.  Examples of such restrictions could be
default mount options that disable set-user/group-ID
attributes, disabling block or character-special files on
the medium, or remapping the user/group IDs of files away
from 0.

the execution of programs with superuser privileges, 
such programs should also be supplied in a 
human-readable form. </P

would have to blindly trust a piece of software,
particularly its security.</P
